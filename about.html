            <h2>Hi! My name is Dawit Kasy, and I am a freshmen at Quinnipiac University studying Computer Science.</h2>
            <h2>Education</h2>
            <p1>
                I completed my high school education at Mountain Mission High School in 2023, 
                and I am curently enrolled at Quinnipiac University, where I anticipate graduating in 2027. </p1>
            <h2>Why did I choose Computer Science?</h2>
            <p1>With how involved technology is in everyday use, I was always extremely curious to learn how it worked.
                I wanted learn how computers turn a bunch of 1's and 0's into the incredible applications we all use today, and 
                apply what I learn be able to build something I would want to use. I currently, have about one school year's
                worth of experience learning in the Java programming language. I have experience with Object Oriented Programming principles
                and certain data structures such as Lists, Stacks, and Queues.
